Are you not aware how God sets forth the parable of a good word? <b>[It is] like a good tree, firmly rooted, [reaching out] with its branches towards the sky, yielding its fruit at all times by its Sustainer's leave.</b> And [thus it is that] God propounds parables unto men, so that they might bethink themselves [of the truth].<b><i> (Qur'an - Surah Ibrahim 14:24-25)</i></b>
